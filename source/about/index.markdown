My name is Tai Toh. Professionally, I work as a User Experience Architect in Toronto, Canada. My current employer is [kobo](http://kobo.com/ "Get your eBooks here") where I work as the Director of User Experience. I get to do a lot of amazing stuff and I have an absolutely first-class team there. 

I'm also a husband and a father of two wonderful daughters, Evelyn and Emily.

Pixels and Widgets is a blog that I started in 2002. I updated it consistently for about 4 years, and then sporadically.  In 2009, I migrated to Drupal which saw a small resurgence in my writing, but I soon grew tired with the horrible authoring interface. I've since migrated to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Hacker blogging."), a Jekyll-based theme created by [Brandon Mathis](http://brandonmathis.com/). It's nice to be able to just write again, although admittedly, I am very out-of-practice.
