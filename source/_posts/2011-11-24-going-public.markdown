One of the cool things with Octopress is that it has a built-in integration with GitHub.  I'm not too familiar with distributed versioning systems, but this is cool.  I used to do this with my other sites HTML templates using Subversion (I had a remote Gentoo server at one point).

GitHub has a free account status--you're given 5 public repositories.

Public? Yes, I was wondering if that was a wise thing, I mean, anyone could download my blog and replicate. Then again, you can do that right now with very little effort.
