I spent about 30 minutes talking to my wife about how excited I was to do this.  It's been a long time since I've been excited to write online again. 

When I first started writing online, it was 2002.  I was between jobs (what was the beginning of a 6-month hiatus from the employed world) and I was poking around OS X.  I remember reading this article on O'Reilly about serving Web pages using the built-in apache Web server in Mac OS X 10.1. At the end of the article was a suggestion to install this thing called [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org "Movable Types Blogging engine"). It was my first foray into blogs.  I soon got it running on my iBook G3 and eventually set up a site at [Blacksun](http://www.blacksun.ca "BlackSun is a Canadian Web Hosting Company out of Saskatchewan").  I blogged consistently for about 3 years.  Late in 2004, licensing decisions by SixApart forced me to re-evaluate my use of MovableType.  I chose Dean Allen's [TextPattern](http://www.textpattern.com "A flexible, easy-to-use content management system").

In retrospect, the move was unwarranted, most of the licensing stuff with MovableType were resolved in the 3.2 point-release. The only thing that changing systems  really did was **interrupt my writing**.

Since [TextPattern](http://www.textpattern.com "A poor man's ExpressionEngine--I still like it a lot"), I've used [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org "Maybe I should have stuck with this one, it definitely has the community behind it.", [ModX](http://www.modx.com "Kind of like Textpattern"), [ExpressionEngine](http://www.expressionengine.com "Got interesting when they finally released it with a Code Igniter backend") and finally found some consistent success with Drupal.  I have found things to like on all platforms.

However, I wrote less and less--and when I did, I was usually angry at something (in Drupal's case, it was Drupal itself).  In actuality, I fiddled with code more and more.  It was enjoyable, but code never provide the same voice and outlet for me as keeping an online journal.

## Enter Baked Goodness ##

One of the cool things about MovableType was that your site was statically generated each time you made a post.  The Perl script would create a multitude of HTML files, write hundreds hyper-linking and cross-linking and comment management every time you hit the publish button.  One great thing is that I have all my posts in HTML.  It's very easy to keep the same URLS when all you need to do is point to static HTML.

I suppose this became pass√© with the drive to database driven websites.  

One of the emerging trends that I am seeing is a more back-to-basics approach using scripting languages to publish static content.  For a simple blog, it is more than enough.

I looked at several systems:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.") - Ruby-based, good documentation and large community.
* [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com "Hyde is a static website generator written in python.") - Python-based, **horrible** documentation, but good community.
* [Blogofile](http://blogofile.com "Blogofile is a static website compiler, primarily (though not exclusively) designed to be a simple blogging engine.")- Kind of like Hyde, also written in Python.
* [Stacey](http://staceyapp.com "Stacey is a lightweight content management system.") - A PHP version that requires you scaffold your site using your file sys

I ended up going with Jekyll as the community have really tried hard to put together comprehensive documentation.
