**How do I migrate posts dating back from 2002?**

Probably best to write a script, I guess. Most of these posts exist in a local textpattern install that I have working in VM, so I guess, the easiest thing for me would be to create an article template that mirrored the Octopress text format.

It would be trivial to parse this into static files.
