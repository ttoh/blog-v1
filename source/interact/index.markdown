## No Comments

I've chosen to go about managing this blog with as little headaches as possible. Consequently, I've chosen not to implement comments. On one side, I've lost the rich treasure trove of comments dating back to 2002. For that I am regretful.  However, this blog serves as an outlet for me, and I don't want to be burdened with the management and adminstration overhead.

This blog is meant to be frictionless.

## The best way to interact with me

There are so many different ways to interact with me. If you feel you have something important to say you can always reach me on twitter.  My twitter handle is [taitoh][1].

If 140 characters isn't enough, please don't hesitate to email me at _*tai (at this domain)*_.

If you think what you have to say is important, there are a multitude of free blogging platforms to choose from. Here are a few:

* [Blogger.com][2]
* [Tumblr.com][3]
* [Wordpress.org][4]

I'm more than willing to continue the conversation at length this way.

Regards,

Tai
